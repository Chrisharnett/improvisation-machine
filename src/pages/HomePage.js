      creation of spontaneous music. This is the first prototype is designed to
      deliver randomized prompts from a bank of available prompts. Once this
      proof of concept is refined, performers will be given a choice to prompts
      to choose from to create a database of "preferred" prompts. That dataset
      will ideally inform a machine learning model to automate the delivery of
      prompts to users. As that machine learning model grows, the app will
      collect audience feedback during performance to further refine the model
      choices. */}
