# The A5tral8og Improvisation Machine
This app gives customized prompts to improvisers to help direct the creation of spontaneous music. This is the first prototype is designed to deliver randomized prompts from a bank of available prompts. Once this proof of concept is refined, performers will be given a choice to prompts to choose from to create a database of "preferred" prompts. That dataset will be used to train a machine learning model to automate the delivery of prompts to users. This flips the paradigm of AI we usually see with AI art. AI will give a prompt to humans and humans will create the music. As that machine learning model grows, the app will collect audience feedback during performance to further refine the model choices.

The A5tral8og improvisation machine is currently built with a React front end, AWS serverless backed using API gateway and Lambda integrations. It is currently deployed using AWS services at a5tral8og.com.
